# Project Idea: Automated News Sentiment Tracker

# Overview:

The Automated News Sentiment Tracker is a data pipeline designed to extract articles from a news website, analyze the sentiment of each article, and provide real-time visual insights through an interactive dashboard. The pipeline is fully automated, ensuring that data is collected, processed, and visualized at scheduled intervals without manual intervention.

# Key Features:

1. Web Scraping:
   * Extract articles, publication dates, and authors from a target news website.
* Store the scraped data in a structured format for further processing.

2. Sentiment Analysis:
   * Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify the sentiment of each article as positive, negative, or neutral.
* Add sentiment scores to the dataset for deeper analysis.

3. Database Integration:
   * Load the cleaned and analyzed data into a cloud-hosted MySQL database.
* Implement deduplication to ensure no redundant data is stored.

5. Automation:
   Schedule the entire Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process using GitHub Actions for efficient, hands-free data processing.

6. Data Visualization:
   * Build an interactive dashboard in Power BI to showcase:
     * Sentiment trends over time.
     * Articles categorized by sentiment.
     * Author contributions and their sentiment distribution.
* Enable automatic dashboard refresh to ensure the latest data is always displayed.

* Challenge: Implementing automation with GitHub Actions instead of traditional tools like Airflow.
    * Solution: Leverage GitHub Actionsâ€™ flexibility to write a robust workflow for scheduling and executing scripts.
* Challenge: Cleaning unstructured text data for accurate sentiment analysis.
    * Solution: Use preprocessing techniques like removing stopwords, punctuation, and irrelevant characters.

# Technologies and Tools:

* Python: For scripting and ETL processes.
BeautifulSoup & Requests: For web scraping.
* NLTK: For sentiment analysis.
* PyMySQL: For database operations.
* GitHub Actions: For pipeline automation.
* Power BI: For creating an interactive dashboard.

# Outcomes:

* A scalable and fully automated solution for tracking news sentiment.
* Insights into how sentiment varies over time and across topics or authors.
* Practical experience in using modern data engineering tools and techniques.

This project is an excellent opportunity to showcase expertise in data engineering, natural language processing, and business intelligence, while solving real-world challenges in media analysis!
